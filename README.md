# EE698-R-studies
Comparative studies for Advanced Topics in Maachine Learning   

This repository contains the code done as part of the course EE698-R at IITK under Prof. Vipul Arora. It features studies to get an understanding about the latest techniques in Maachine Learning like : 

*Normalizing Flows*   
*Generative Adverserial Networks*  
*Variational Auto-Encoders*   

`A1` contains a study on modelling a `GMM` using various `Normalizing Flows` like `RNVP` and `Planar Flow`. 

`A2` contains a comparative study between `GANs` and `VAEs` for modelling a `GMM`.
